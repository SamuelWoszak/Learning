#You need to calculate the int part of a sqrt(x) but you CANT use ANY POWER PROPERTY or MULTIPLICATION envolving x (the number that YOU are using).

#Explain: an perfect square can be write as the sum of the first n digits by nÂ², u can proof this by using de P.A formula with n = 1 and ending at n, the number
#that you want to know the square root.
#By the first comment, you can see that the only time that i use "x" is in the if and the while, you cant use math.sqrt(x) or pow() or ** function, and not envolve x
#anywhere
